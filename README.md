# Linear Regression Analysis on Spotify Dataset

This repository contains an analysis of Spotify data using linear regression techniques. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), making it easy to follow along with the steps and reproduce the results.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nurulashraf/linear-regression-spotify.git
   cd linear-regression-spotify
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Open the desired `.ipynb` file in your browser.

4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Analysis Overview

### Simple Linear Regression
This notebook examines the relationship between one independent variable and a dependent variable using a simple linear regression model.

### Multiple Linear Regression (2 Variables)
This notebook expands the analysis by including two independent variables in the model.

### Multiple Linear Regression (More Variables)
This notebook builds a comprehensive model using multiple independent variables to predict the dependent variable.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is stored in the `data/spotify_track.csv` file. It contains the necessary features for performing the analysis. If you use a custom dataset, ensure it follows the same format.

---

## Visualisations

The Jupyter Notebooks include various visualisations to aid understanding:
- Scatter plots
- Regression lines
- Residual plots
- Metrics comparison charts
